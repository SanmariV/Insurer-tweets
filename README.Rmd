```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is the code I used to generate a Shiny dashboard that pulls down the Tweets from short-term insurers for the past 6-9 days.

**South African short-term insurers** that are available to choose from on the dashboard:

 - Pineapple Insurance
 
 - Budget Insurance
 
 - Naked Insurance
 
 - Discovery Insure
 
 - Santam
 
 - Old Mutual's iWyze
 
 - King Price Insurance
 
 - Outsurance
 
 - MiWay
 
 - Hollard
